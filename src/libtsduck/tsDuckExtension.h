    //!
    //! A TSDuck Extension is a dynamically loaded shared library. It is typically
    //! provided by some third party. Unlike tsp plugins, a TSDuck extension
    //! shared library has no callable interface. Instead, it statically registers
    //! hooks inside the TSDuck library, when the TSDuck extension shared library
    //! is loaded.
    //!
    //! A TSDuck extension library is identified by the exported symbol
    //! "TSDuckExtensionId" which contains a pointed to a static instance of
    //! the class DuckExtension.
    //!
    //! The constructor is typically used inside a TSDuck library extension.
    //! The "getters" are typically used from TSDuck itself to identify the extensions.
    //!
